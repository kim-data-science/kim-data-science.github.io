## Statistical Inference - Part 1

This post is the first part of the introduction of statistical inference series.
For part 1, we will review about

- Population statistics estimation with sample
- Central Limit Theorem
- Confidence Interval (CI) and Confidence Level (CL)


Those concepts are foundational but often misinterpreted, so it's nice to review them throughly.

Following link has a concise introduction with examples codes written in python.
