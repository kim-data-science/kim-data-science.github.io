## SSH to EC2 Instance (Mac)

### Prerequisites
- **EC2 Instance**: Running Linux instance
- **Key Pair**: Downloaded .pem file from EC2 launch
- **Public IP**: EC2 instance public IP address
- **Security Group**: SSH (port 22) access allowed

### SSH Connection Steps

#### 1. Prepare Key File
```bash
# Navigate to directory containing your .pem file
cd ~/Downloads

# Set correct permissions (required for security)
# Note that do not include space in file name
chmod 400 your-key-name.pem
```

#### 2. Connect to EC2 Instance
```bash
# Basic SSH connection
ssh -i your-key-name.pem ec2-user@your-public-ip

# Are you sure you want to continue connecting -> yes
```

#### 3. First Connection
- **Welcome message**: You'll see the EC2 instance welcome screen
- **You're connected**: You now have terminal access to your EC2 instance
- **Disconnect**: Use `exit` or `Ctrl+D` to disconnect


### Troubleshooting

#### Permission Denied
```bash
# Check key file permissions
ls -la your-key-name.pem

# Fix permissions if needed
chmod 400 your-key-name.pem
```

#### Connection Timeout
- **Check Security Group**: Ensure SSH (port 22) is allowed
- **Check Instance State**: Verify instance is running
- **Check Public IP**: Confirm you're using the correct IP
