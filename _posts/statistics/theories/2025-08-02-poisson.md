## Poisson Distribution

### Definition
The Poisson distribution describes the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time, given a constant average rate of occurrence. It is a discrete probability distribution for count data.


### Mathematical Formula

#### Probability Mass Function
$$P(X = k) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^k}{k!}$$

Where:
- $\lambda$ = average rate of occurrence, expectation of number of events in a given interval
- $k$ = number of events in the same interval

#### Mean and Variance
$$\mu = \lambda$$

$$\sigma^2 = \lambda$$

### Python Implementation

For detailed Python implementations, examples, and data science applications, see the accompanying Jupyter notebook:

**[ðŸ““ Poisson Distribution - Python Implementation](https://github.com/kim-data-science/kim-data-science.github.io/blob/main/_posts/statistics/theories/poisson_distribution.ipynb)**


### Notes
- **Normal Approximation**: When $\lambda > 20$ (varies depending on source), Poisson can be approximated by normal distribution
