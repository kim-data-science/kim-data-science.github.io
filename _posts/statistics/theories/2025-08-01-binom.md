## Binomial Distribution

### Definition$
The binomial distribution describes the number of successes ($k$) in a fixed number of independent trials ($n$), each with the same probability of success ($p$). It is a discrete function of integer values (0, 1, 2, ..., n) and applicable for binary outcome.

### Mathematical Formula

#### Probability Mass Function
$$P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$$

Where:
- $n$ = number of trials
- $k$ = number of successes
- $p$ = probability of success
- $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$ (binomial coefficient)

#### Mean and Variance
$$\mu = np$$
$$\sigma^2 = np(1-p)$$

### Python Implementation

For detailed Python implementations, examples, and data science applications, see the accompanying Jupyter notebook:

### Notes
- **Normal Approximation**: When $n$ is large and $p$ is not sall (one practical choice can be $n>30$ and $p > 0.05$), binomial can be approximated by normal distribution
- **Poisson Approximation**: When $n$ is large, $p$ is small, and $np$ is finite, binomial approaches Poisson distribution
