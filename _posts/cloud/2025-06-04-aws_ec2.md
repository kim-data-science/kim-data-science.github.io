### Important Notes
- **Stop instance**: Stop instance when not in use to avoid EC2 instance charges. After you stop the instance, you are no longer charged usage or data transfer fees for it. However, you will still be billed for associated Elastic IP addresses and EBS volumes.
- **Terminate**: Terminate instances when you don't neet it any longer to avoid charges.
- **Region**: Choose based on pricing, proximity, and regulation.
- **IP address**: Whenever restart the EC2 instance, Public IP address changed while Private IP address remains same.
